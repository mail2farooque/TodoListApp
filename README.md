Todo
====

This sample demonstrates a Todo list application where the data is stored and accessed in a local SQLite database.

The app functionality is:

- View a list of tasks.
- Add a new item to the list of tasks.
- Delete task from list and database

In all cases the tasks are stored in a local SQLite database.

_Note_: This sample may not work on Xamarin Live Player due to dependency on SQLite.
